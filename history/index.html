<p>This is a short outline of the history of the development of the different parts of the Ecdar tools.</p>
<p>These versions all had the problem that the GUI was designed for the Uppaal TIGA semantics and thus did not match the Ecdar Timed Input/Output Automata (TIOA) semantics. This version also inherited most of the extension of Timed Automata (TA), including a lot of features that did not have defined semantics in the associated papers. Uses the .xml file format.</p>
<p>This version contained a simulator that linked with the old Ecdar TIGA based verification engine. And a mutation based conformance testing tool.</p>
<p>Simultaneously a tool for visualizing zones in three dimensions was developed, but not integrated with the other tools.</p>
<p>As of the spring of 2021 this code is being worked on to make it feature complete and enable research based on this tool. (j-Ecdar on github)</p>
